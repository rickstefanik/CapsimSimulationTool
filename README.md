# CapsimSimulationTool
Tool I developed to use for a business simulation in one of my classes.  With the use of this tool, my team and I won first place in our industry of six teams. I developed the tool using vanilla javascript in a quick and dirty manner, knowing this code would only be used for the duration of the business simulation.
